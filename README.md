# 👋 Hello World! I'm Katya 🎨👩‍💻🎹

Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! I'm a 39-year-old tech enthusiast who has journeyed through the realms of QA and test automation, and now I'm on an exciting new path towards becoming a frontend or full stack developer.

## 🚀 My Journey So Far

Before my maternity leave, I spent over 11 years perfecting the art of breaking things (in a good way!) as a Test Automation and QA Lead. But during my time off, I discovered a new love—JavaScript. It all started with learning Cypress for test automation, and from there, I fell down the rabbit hole of web development. I’ve been soaking up knowledge like a sponge through Udemy courses, diving deep into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js API, Jest, and more!

## 🎨 Beyond the Code

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me indulging in my love for art and photo editing in Adobe Lightroom. I’m also learning to play the piano (mostly kids' songs for now, but hey, it’s a start!). Creativity fuels my passion, both in tech and in life.

## 💻 What’s Next?

I’m eager to return to the tech world and apply my new skills in a frontend or full stack developer role. If you’re looking for someone with a solid QA background, a fresh perspective on modern web technologies, and a passion for continuous learning, let's connect!
